<h1 class="h1i">HTML Introduction :</h1>
<p class="pi">HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, serves as the backbone of the World Wide Web. It is a standard markup language used to create and design web pages. HTML provides the structure for web documents by using a system of tags and attributes to define the various elements within a page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.</p>

<p class="pi">Introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, HTML has evolved significantly over the years, with new versions introducing enhanced features and capabilities. Despite the advancements in web development technologies, HTML remains fundamental to building web pages, providing a foundation upon which other technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript can be layered to add styling and interactivity.</p>
    
    <p class="pi">HTML documents consist of a series of elements, each enclosed within angle brackets "<" ">", which define the structure and content of a web page. These elements are organized in a hierarchical structure, forming the DOM (Document Object Model), which browsers use to render web pages.</p>
    
   <p class="pi"> HTML is a versatile language, enabling developers to create websites ranging from simple static pages to complex web applications. Its simplicity and widespread adoption make it accessible to beginners while offering advanced features for seasoned developers.</p>
    
   <p class="pi"> In summary, HTML is the cornerstone of web development, providing the structure and framework necessary for creating engaging and interactive web experiences on the Internet.</p>
